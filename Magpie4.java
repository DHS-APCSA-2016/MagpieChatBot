            "Newton's second law of motion can be formally stated as follows: The acceleration of an object as produced by a net force is directly proportional to the magnitude of the net force, in the same direction as the net force, and inversely proportional to the mass of the object.",
            "Newton's first lawof motion - sometimes referred to as the lawof inertia. Newton's first law of motion is often stated as. An object at rest stays at rest and an object in motion stays in motion with the same speed and in the same direction unless acted upon by an unbalanced force.",
            "For every force there is a reaction force that is equal in size, but opposite in direction. That is to say that whenever an object pushes another object it gets pushed back in the opposite direction equally hard.",
            "The AP cirriculum for physics involves for 4 exams: AP Physics 1, AP Physics 2, AP Physics C: Mechanics, and AP Physics C: Electricity and Magnetism. The last two examinations are calculus based, whereas the first two are concept-based. All exams are survey introductory physics courses.",
            "The branch of physics that deals with the motion of material objects. The term mechanics generally refers to the motion of large objects, whereas the study of motion at the level of the atom or smaller is the domain of quantum mechanics.",
            "Flux is the amount of ?something? (electric field, bananas, whatever you want) passing through a surface. The total flux depends on strength of the field, the size of the surface it passes through, and their orientation.",
            "Momentum is a commonly used term in sports. A team that has the momentum is on the move and is going to take some effort to stop. A team that has a lot of momentum is really on the move and is going to be hard to stop. Momentum is a physics term; it refers to the quantity of motion that an object has. A sports team that is on the move has the momentum. If an object is in motion (on the move) then it has momentum.",
            "Velocity is a vector quantity that refers to 'the rate at which an object changes its position.' Imagine a person moving rapidly - one step forward and one step back - always returning to the original starting position. While this might result in a frenzy of activity, it would result in a zero velocity. Because the person always returns to the original position, the motion would never result in a change in position. Since velocity is defined as the rate at which the position changes, this motion results in zero velocity. If a person in motion wishes to maximize their velocity, then that person must make every effort to maximize the amount that they are displaced from their original position. Every step must go into moving that person further from where he or she started. For certain, the person should never change directions and begin to return to the starting position.",
            "Acceleration is the rate of change of velocity of an object. where a is acceleration, v is the final velocity of the object, u is the initial velocity of the object and t is the time that has elapsed. This equation can be rearranged to give: v = u + at.",
            "Displacement is defined as the distance, in any direction, of an object relative to the position of another object. Physicists use the concept of a position vector as a graphical tool to visualize displacements. A position vector expresses the position of an object from the origin of a coordinate system.",
            "Torque is the twisting force that tends to cause rotation. The point where the object rotates is known as the axis of rotation. Mathematically torque can be written as T = F * r * sin(theta), and it has units of Newton-meters. When the sum of all torques acting on an object equals zero, it is in rotational equilibrium.",
            "Moments are usually defined with respect to a fixed reference point; they deal with physical quantities as measured at some distance from that reference point. For example, the moment of force acting on an object, often called torque, is the product of the force and the distance from a reference point.",
            "Inertia is the resistance of any physical object to any change in its state of motion; this includes changes to its speed, direction or state of rest. It is the tendency of objects to keep moving in a straight line at constant velocity.",
            "In physics, something that causes a change in the motion of an object. The modern definition of force (an object's mass multiplied by its acceleration) was given by Isaac Newton in Newton's laws of motion. The most familiar unit of force is the pound.",

            "Maxwell's equations describe how electric charges and electric currents create electric and magnetic fields. Further, they describe how an electric field can generate a magnetic field, and vice versa. The first equation allows you to calculate the electric field created by a charge. The second allows you to calculate the magnetic field. The other two describe how fields 'circulate' around their sources. Magnetic fields 'circulate' around electric currents and time varying electric fields, Amp≈†re's law with Maxwell's correction, while electric fields 'circulate' around time varying magnetic fields, Faraday's law.",

Capacitance is defined as the ratio of the electric charge Q on each conductor to the potential difference V between them. The SI unit of capacitance is the farad (F), which is equal to one coulomb per volt (1 C/V).",
            "An inductor, also called a coil or reactor, is a passive two-terminal electrical component which resists changes in electric current passing through it. It consists of a conductor such as a wire, usually wound into a coil. Energy is stored in a magnetic field in the coil as long as current flows.",
            "Ampere's Law, specifically, says that the magnetic field created by an electric current is proportional to the size of that electric current with a constant of proportionality equal to the permeability of free space. Stationary charges produce electric fields proportional to the magnitude of the charge.",

            "A pendulum is a weight suspended from a pivot so that it can swing freely. When a pendulum is displaced sideways from its resting, equilibrium position, it is subject to a restoring force due to gravity that will accelerate it back toward the equilibrium position.",
            "A period T is the time needed for one complete cycle of vibration to pass a given point. As the frequency of a wave increases, the period of the wave decreases. Frequency and Period are in a reciprocal relationship that can be expressed mathematically as: Period equals the Total time divided by the Number of cycles.",
            "An oscillation can be a periodic motion that repeats itself in a regular cycle, such as a sine wave, the side to side swing of a pendulum, or the up and down motion of a spring with a weight.",
            "The normal force is the support force exerted upon an object that is in contact with another stable object. For example, if a book is resting upon a surface, then the surface is exerting an upward force upon the book in order to support the weight of the book.",
